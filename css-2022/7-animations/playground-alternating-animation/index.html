    Above we spend the first half of the duration growing to be 1.5x with scale() from its default size.
    Once it reaches that peak, it spends the second half shrinking back down to 1x.
    There is a more-elegant way to accomplish the same effect using the animation-direction property. 
    We can control the order of the @keyframes.
    The default value is the normal direction, from your '0%' and to your '100%' over the specified duration.
    
    We can also reverse that will play the animation backwards, going from 100% to 0%.
    Another interesting one is alternate as it ping-pongs between normal and reverse on subsequent iterations.
