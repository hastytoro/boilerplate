    We're saying that the "core" should span half of the available width and full height.
    NOTE: Creating a gradient ellipse that can get really complicated really fast, and there is no need to go down the rabbit hole. Instead, let's focus on circular radial gradients.
    We can "lock-in" the shape using the circle at prefix. We'll use it here to create a sunset effect:

    Our circular gradient "core" is centered at 50%, 100%. That means the midpoint is along the bottom edge. The colors radiate outwards from this point using color-stop to define the shape.
    Codepen user Marty has created a beautiful interactive sunset using linear and radial gradients.
    Looking for more information in radial gradients MDN Web Docs has an in-depth article.
