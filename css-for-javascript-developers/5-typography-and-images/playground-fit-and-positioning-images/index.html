      <h4>Fit and Position</h4>
      <p>
        Understand that the img element is fundamentally weird. As it’s known as
        a “replacing element”. Unlike other DOM Nodes the browser replaces the
        img tag with a foreign entity, being the image itself. So images aren't
        like other elements and they have rules we need to consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Images are "go with the flow" elements.</p>
          <p>
            Meaning by default they inline and we can't give those elements
            height, since that would mess with layout. And yet images can be
            given a height.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Images come with their own intrinsic size.</p>
          <p>
            They based on the dimensions of the image file. Here our img has a
            natural size of 400×300.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Images also have an intrinsic aspect ratio.</p>
          <p>
            If we only supply one dimension width or height, the other dimension
            scales up or down as-needed -- to preserve aspect ratio.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What happens if we provide both properties?</p>

      <h4>Intrinsic size</h4>
      <p>
        Images come with their own intrinsic size, based on the dimensions of
        the image file. In this example, our image has a natural size of
        400x300:
      </p>
      <img src="size-400-300.png" alt="" />

      <h4>Continued... distorting images intrinsic aspect ratio</h4>
      <p>
        Image also have a intrinsic aspect ratio. Meaning if we only supply one
        dimension, either width or height, the other dimension scales up or down
        as-needed, to preserve the aspect ratio.
      </p>
      <img class="example1" src="size-400-300.png" alt="" />
      <p>By default, the image will distort. :(</p>
      <p>
        The default behavior is almost never what we want it to do. But the
        better alternative in most cases is to crop the image, trimming off any
        excess that can't fit in the specified measurement.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="placeholder">
      <h4>Modern CSS includes tools that help like object-fit.</h4>

      <h5>- object-fit: fill (default)</h5>
      <img class="example2" src="size-400-300.png" alt="" />
      <h5>- object-fit: contain</h5>
      <img class="example3" src="size-400-300.png" alt="" />
      <h5>- object-fit: cover (mostly used)</h5>
      <img class="example4" src="size-400-300.png" alt="" />

      <p>
        NOTE: object-fit property works on images, but it isn't exclusive to
        images. It can also be used on video tags. In general, it's less
        relevant with videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using the cover value, the browser will crop our image so that we
        see the very center of the image, and trim off the edges. But in some
        cases, we'll want to use a different anchor point.

        When using the cover value, the browser will crop our image so that we

      </p>

      <img class="example5" src="size-400-300.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        The object-position is how the image should be translated or cropped
        within its available space. The property takes two numbers, one
        horizontal offset and one for the vertical offset.
