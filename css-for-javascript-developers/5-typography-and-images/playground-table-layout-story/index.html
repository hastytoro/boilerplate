    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <h3>The Secret Agent</h3>
    <p>
      Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time, and then he
      shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts and moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barrier surrounding the caisse comes as high as your chin, and the
      caissier, who is generally nothing more than a minor bank clerk, sits on a
      stool and dips into his piles of notes and plaques. These are ranged on
      shelves. They are on a level, behind the protecting barrier* with your
      groin. The caissier has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave over
      the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and get out of the
      Casino through the passages and doors would be im- possible. And the
      caissiers generally work in pairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of
      hundred-thousand and then the sheaves of ten- thousand-franc notes. With
      another part of his mind, he had a vision of tomorrow's regular morning
      meeting of the Casino committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his usual game. Miss
      Fairchild made a million an hour and then left. She executed\hree bancos
      of Monsieur Le Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with
      coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million two at
      roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first and last dozens. He was
      lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Englishman, Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three
      million over the two days. He was playing a progressive system on red at
      table five. Duclos, the chef de partie, has the details. It seems that he
      is per- severing and pays in maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good.
      On the soiree, the chemin-de-fer won x, the baccarat won.y and the
      roulette won z. The boule, which was again badly frequented, still makes
      its ex- penses.'
