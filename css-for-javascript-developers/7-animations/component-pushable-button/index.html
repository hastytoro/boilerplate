    As the user (transitions) over the <span> :hover we want to overwrite the current transform defined in the default class declaration block, to be quicker at 250ms.
    As you leave that element's :hover state the user will again (transition) back to the default transform, slowing falling back to normal.
    Lastly when the user (transition) into the :active state for the element we have a quicker transform applied and when released, again the default slower animation is applied.
    NOTE: keep in mind because both states we managing have the same specificity, the one applied last wins. So if we had to switch them the hovering action will be the only other state involved.
