    scale()
    This function allows us to grow or shrink an element.
    It uses unitless values representing multiples like line-height. scale(2) means that the element should be x2 as big as it would normally be.
    We can also pass multiple values to scale the x and y-axis independently.

    At first glance this might seem equivalent to setting width and height.
    However what happens when our element has some text in it. The text scales up and down with the element.
    We aren't just transforming the size and shape of the box, we're transforming the entire element and all of its descendants.

    An important truth about transforms, elements are flattened into a texture.
    All transforms essentially treat an element like a flat image warping and contorting it as you might in Photoshop.
    Thatâ€™s why they so important for animations! Think about how much work is required when we change something like width.
